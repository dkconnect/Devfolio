About me

hey.

I’m Dibyanshu, but most people call me Luci. I’m an undergraduate student at IIT Madras with a passion for programming and an ambition to build a career in finance or fintech. Right now, I spend my days programming and my nights chasing my dreams while also romanticizing every sleepless hour along the way.

There’s not much more to add for now, but hopefully, the next time you visit, you’ll find more stories, experiences, and maybe a few extra lines here.
