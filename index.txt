About me

hey.

I’m Dibyanshu, but most people call me Luci. 
I’m an undergraduate student at IIT Madras with a passion for finance, and technology. 
By day, I work am a student and a programmer, and by night, I dive deep into finance, programming, and machine learning 
while also romanticizing every sleepless hour along the way.

Currently, I’m learning advanced programming, financial modeling and the math behind it while preparing for CFA Level 1. 
I’m also experimenting with the Godot game engine to bring one of my ideas to life.

I love building, learning, and pushing myself beyond limits. 
There’s still so much more to explore, and hopefully, the next time you visit, 
I’ll have even more to share.
